# Messenger AI reply (Gemini via Vertex AI)

`facebookAiReply` is a Firestore trigger. When a customer message is stored in
`messenger_conversations/{id}/messages`, it asks Gemini to answer using the
available properties in the `properties` collection and sends the reply with the
page token. It is **off by default**.

## Settings (no deploy needed)

Document `messenger_settings/ai` in Firestore. Read on every message, so changes
apply immediately. The on/off switch is also in the admin Messenger inbox
(Super Admin only).

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` turns the bot on. Anything else keeps it off. |
| `model` | string | Gemini model id. The default (`gemini-2.5-flash`) has been retired, so set this. |
| `location` | string | Vertex AI region, e.g. `us-central1` or `global`. Default `us-central1`. |
| `particle` | string | `ครับ` (default) or `ค่ะ`: how the bot ends sentences. |
| `extraInstructions` | string | Tone or brand notes appended to the prompt, e.g. "เรียกลูกค้าว่าพี่". |
| `maxRepliesPerHour` | number | Per conversation. Default 8 (property cards don't count). |

## Company facts and FAQ

Collection `messenger_faq`, one document per entry:
`{ question: string, answer: string, active: boolean }`. The bot answers
company questions only from these entries (up to 40, cached for 5 minutes).

## What the bot can do

| Tool | What happens |
|---|---|
| `search_properties` | Searches available listings: place (with synonyms like อมตะนคร/อมตะซิตี้), type, budget, bedrooms, keywords. If nothing matches it loosens filters and says so. Properties already shown in the chat are not offered again. |
| `show_property_cards` | Sends up to 3 Messenger cards (photo, place, rooms, price, "ดูรายละเอียด" button). A failure here never undoes the text reply. |
| `save_customer_info` | Saves name / phone / email / budget / interest into the conversation's `contact` (never overwrites what a teammate typed) and sets `leadCapturedAt` when it gets a phone or email. |
| `request_appointment` | Creates a document in `appointments` (`type: 'Customer'`, `status: 'pending'`, `source: 'messenger-ai'`). The existing `onAppointmentCreated` trigger sends the LINE notification. The bot never confirms a time itself. |
| `request_human` | Hands the conversation to a person. |

## Prices

- Price shown on the website (`showPrice !== false`): the bot may say it.
- Price hidden: the bot only receives a masked approximation, e.g. `2.1xxx ล้านบาท`
  (rent: `8,xxx บาท/เดือน`) and never the exact figure. Lines about money are
  removed from the listing description for hidden-price listings.
- After the model answers, code checks the reply. If it contains an exact hidden
  price it is replaced with a hand-off message and the chat is paused for a human.
- Links must come from search results (or the site root); other links are removed.

## What it never does

- Exposes `agentContact`, `commissionRate`, `createdBy`, coordinates or map links.
- Answers while a human is handling the chat (any non-AI outgoing message in the
  last 12 hours) or when the conversation has `botPaused: true`.

## Hand-off and review

When the model calls `request_human`, an appointment is requested, or a safety
check blocks a reply, the conversation gets `botPaused: true`, `needsHuman: true`,
`handoffReason` and `handoffAt`. The admin inbox shows a "รอเจ้าหน้าที่" badge;
"เปิดต่อ" lets the bot answer that conversation again.

AI messages carry an "AI ·" tag and thumbs up/down buttons. Ratings are stored on
the message as `aiFeedback` for later review.

## Requirements

- Vertex AI API enabled on the `sps-property` project and permission for the
  Cloud Functions service account to call it (`roles/aiplatform.user`).
- Firestore rules deployed (`messenger_settings`, `messenger_faq`).
- `LINE_TOKEN` and LINE admin IDs configured if appointment alerts should reach LINE.
